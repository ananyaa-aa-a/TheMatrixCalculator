# TheMatrixCalculator

The Matrix Operations Toolkit is a comprehensive Java program that showcases advanced Object-oriented programming constructs and methodologies while addressing a range of matrix operations. This project encompasses a variety of fundamental concepts such as constructors, copy constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism, object-as-function parameters, exception handling, container classes, and GUI with Swing components.

Functional Requirements:

1. Matrix Multiplication:
Implement a matrix multiplication algorithm to efficiently multiply two matrices of compatible dimensions. Utilize object-oriented principles to encapsulate matrix data and operations.

2. Partitioning of Matrices:
Develop a feature to partition matrices based on user-defined criteria. Implement methods for splitting matrices into submatrices to facilitate complex calculations.

3. Evaluation of Determinant:
Design an algorithm to calculate the determinant of a square matrix. Demonstrate the use of recursion and object-oriented design to handle matrix size dynamically.

4. Inverse of Square Matrix:
Implement a mechanism to find the inverse of a square matrix. Utilize exception handling to address scenarios where an inverse may not exist.

5. Rank of a Matrix:
Develop a function to determine the rank of a matrix. Apply object-oriented principles to create a modular and extensible rank calculation mechanism.


Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Demonstrated:

1. Constructors: Use constructors to initialize matrix objects and set default values.
2. Copy Constructors: Implement copy constructors for creating duplicate matrices.
3. Destructors: Implement cleanup operations and resource release using destructors.
4. Inheritance: Utilize inheritance to create specialized matrix types with shared functionalities.
5. Polymorphism: Demonstrate polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.
6. Object as Function Parameters: Pass matrix objects as parameters to methods for enhanced modularity.
7. Exception Handling: Implement exception handling for scenarios like division by zero or non-existent inverses.
8. Container Classes: Utilize container classes to manage collections of matrices efficiently.
9. GUI with Swing Components: Create a user-friendly graphical interface to interact with the matrix operations toolkit.
    
This Matrix Operations Toolkit not only provides efficient solutions to matrix-related computations but also serves as a learning resource for developers interested in mastering object-oriented programming in Java. The incorporation of a GUI enhances user experience, making it accessible to a wider audience.
